  summary: N-D labeled arrays and datasets in Python.
  description: |
    xarray (formerly xray) is an open source project and Python package
    that makes working with labelled multi-dimensional arrays simple,
    efficient, and fun!

    xarray introduces labels in the form of dimensions, coordinates and
    attributes on top of raw NumPy_-like arrays, which allows for a more
    intuitive, more concise, and less error-prone developer experience.
    The package includes a large and growing library of domain-agnostic functions for advanced analytics and visualization with these data structures.

    xarray was inspired by and borrows heavily from pandas_, the popular data analysis package focused on labelled tabular data.
    It is particularly tailored to working with netCDF_ files, which were the source of xarray's data model, and integrates tightly with dask_ for parallel computing.
